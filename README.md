# junos-bits
Junos config bits, commit &amp; event scripts

* dyn-nat - Pato's old event script to mimic the old ScreenOS behavior of VIP using external IP (ie port forwarding)

* routegen - Perl script to generate a large number of /32 static routes.  Useful for loading up the RIB to check route scale.  Randomly generated, so no guarantee as to uniqueness.
